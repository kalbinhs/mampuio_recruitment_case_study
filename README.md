This project is a RESTful backend service for a digital wallet system, developed using Golang and the Gin framework.
It provides core wallet functionalities such as balance inquiry and fund withdrawal, with persistent storage using PostgreSQL.
The codebase follows a clean layered architecture (handler, service, repository) to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.
This project was built as part of a technical assessment for a backend engineering recruitment process.
